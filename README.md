This package implement a simple system for producing publication-ready 
documentation of a data set (aka codebooks). 
Implemented functions enable producing documents that include summary information for all the variables in the
given data. The package supports producing codebooks in plain text, HTML
as well as LaTeX formats. The flexible design of the system enables
the user to define their own ways the data are summarized in the document
by supplying user-programmed classes and methods that extend the currently
defined ones.
