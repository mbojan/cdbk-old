TODO

Namespace exports everything. Shouldn't.

Add CITATION file

Vignette which explains basic functionality.

Vignette with a gallery of the printing and documentation objects. Is it
possible to show how something will look in HTML?








=============================================================================
Storing data and documentation in a relational database



___Data base schema______

Value labels: Collection of relations value-label

Missing values: Single relation varName-misval

Variables: Single table varName-varlab-vallab, where vallab is either the name
of the relation or the id.

Data: Raw data stored in a single table caseid x varName


In the simplest scheme all information can be stored in four tables.

Desired functionality:

1. Checking consistensy of raw data

2. Checking the consistency of documentation with data

3. Implementing filter checks

4. Automating the production of documentation


Fantasizing:

1. Perhaps it is not neccessary to process the data and write it to DB, just
operate on the existing format as far as it supports RDBMS-like interface.
Large data do not have tobe stored in the R memory.

2. Rewriting SPSS data in chunks using ODBC (not loading everything to memory)
or some other RDBMS engine.

Optimally the functions should be independent of the DB driver used, now SQLite
is hardcoded.



=============================================================================
Use cases


Calling something simple, like cdbk(dataframe) to get the whole codebook
displayed on screen.

Calling cdbk(dataframe, file=file) to get it printed to file.
