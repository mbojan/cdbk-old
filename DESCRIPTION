Description: This package implement a simple system for producing publication-ready
	documentation of a data set (aka codebooks). Implemented functions enable producing
	documents that include summary information for all the variables in the
	given data. The package supports producing codebooks in plain text, HTML
	as well as LaTeX formats. The flexible design of the system enables
	the user to define their own ways the data are summarized in the document
	by supplying user-programmed classes and methods that extend the currently
	defined ones.
